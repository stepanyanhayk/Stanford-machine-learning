Hi all,

Separately, CS50 will also be holding a special lecture via Zoom on artificial intelligence and "machine learning" this Wednesday, 18 November 2020, 1:30pmâ€“2:30pm EDT, led by CS50's own Brian Yu. (Convert to your own time zone.)

Today, computers can drive cars, diagnose diseases, compose music, translate human languages, and more. How do these technologies work? And how can humans build computer systems that are smarter than ourselves? Join us for a discussion of the principles that lie at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence and machine learning.
